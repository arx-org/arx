# Arx compiler

Arx compiler aims to provide arrow datatypes as native datatypes.

For now, it is just the Kaleidoscope compiler with a few changes.

## ROADMAP

* Implement more datatypes
  * int8, int16, int32, int64
  * float16, float32, float64
  * string
  * datetime
* Change the language design (syntax)
* Implement arrow datatypes as native datatypes
